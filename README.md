# pagecount

`pagecount` takes a directory as an input and recurses through this directory,
finding all PDFs and totaling the number of pages.

This was originally created after completing my second semester of 
electrodynamics at Utah State University, and I wanted to know how many pages
of homework I had to write. It was 332.
